Brief description of the game developed: This is a memory game based on the Concentration card game. 
The player turns pairs of cards and has to match pairs and eliminate them with the fewest goes possible 

Justification of spec:
I chose this game as I could use it to demonstrate both object arrays (cards) and primitive arrays (card numbers).
I also created two classes (card and player) with bespoke methods and fields 

Known bugs/problems:
If the player clicks on card twice in a row the game will crash. This is not pat of playing the game but could happen accidentily
