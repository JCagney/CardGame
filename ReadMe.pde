Brief description of the game developed: This is a memory game based on the Concentration card game. 
The player turns pairs of cards and has to match pairs and eliminate them with the fewest goes possible 

Justification of spec:
I chose this game as I could use it to demonstrate both object arrays (cards) and primitive arrays (card numbers).
I also created two classes (card and player) with bespoke methods and fields 

Known bugs/problems:
If the player clicks on card twice in a row the game will crash. This is not pat of playing the game but could happen accidentily

Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (be precise and specific with references) {there no need to reference lecture/lab materials}:
Everything from lectures and labs
